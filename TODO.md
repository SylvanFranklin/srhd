# Current objectives

There are currently some known problems with srhd that I'm trying to resolve as
quickly as possible.  

1. Serurity vulnerablity with `env::current_process`, and hotswapping an exe
2. Lock file related to 1. 
3. Lnclear log messages and error handling
4. Macros for easier definitions of OSA script app launching in `srhd.toml`
5. Config help subcommad
6. Better doc comments
